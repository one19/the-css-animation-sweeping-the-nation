# Encapsulation & Modularity

<Row>
<Column>
## Pros
Benefits of encapsulating animation logic within CSS variables:

triggering the animation is as easy as prop passing!

```tsx
const PuzzleContainer = styled.div`
  --success-start-x: ${x};
  --success-start-y: ${y};
`;
```
_thankfully, undefined values are ignored by the browser_
</Column>
<Column>
### Cons

<ClickReveal>
## IT ALSO DOESN'T FREAKING WORK
</ClickReveal>
</Column>
</Row>
